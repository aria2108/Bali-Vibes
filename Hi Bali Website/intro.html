       <p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bali" target="_blank">Bali</a>(/ˈbɑːli/; Balinese: ᬩᬮᬶ) is a province of Indonesia and the westernmost of the Lesser Sunda Islands. 
        East of Java and west of Lombok, the province includes the island of Bali and a few smaller neighbouring islands, 
        notably Nusa Penida, Nusa Lembongan, and Nusa Ceningan.</p>

               The provincial capital, Denpasar, is the most populous city in the Lesser Sunda Islands 
               and the second-largest, after Makassar, in Eastern Indonesia. 
               The upland town of Ubud in Greater Denpasar is considered Bali's cultural centre. 
               The province is Indonesia's main tourist destination, with a significant rise in tourism since the 1980s. 
               Tourism-related business makes up 80% of its economy.

        Bali is part of the Coral Triangle, the area with the highest biodiversity of marine species, especially fish and turtles.
        In this area alone, over 500 reef-building coral species can be found. For comparison, this is about seven times as many as in the entire Caribbean.
        Bali is the home of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subak_(irrigation)" target="_blank">Subak irrigation system</a>, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
        It is also home to a unified confederation of kingdoms composed of 10 traditional royal Balinese houses, each house ruling a specific geographic area. 
        The confederation is the successor of the Bali Kingdom. The royal houses are not recognised by the government of Indonesia; however, 
        they originated before Dutch colonisation.
